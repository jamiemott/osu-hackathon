# osu-hackathon
Repo for Spring 2020 hackathon

For this hackathon, our team decided we wanted to focus on educational accessibility and learning new skills.  We will be building our website using Python/Flask, which is not something most of us have done before.

The website is located at: https://education-accessibility.herokuapp.com/
